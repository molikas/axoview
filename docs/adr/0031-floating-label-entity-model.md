# ADR 0031 — Floating Label as a First-Class Entity

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Supersedes:** none (resolves the [ux-principles §5](../ux-principles.md) item-type-parity exemption taken by the spike's `variant:'label'` text box; relates to [ADR 0024](0024-node-label-positioning-and-sizing.md) node-label positioning, [ADR 0019](0019-canvas2d-node-render-layer.md) Canvas2D render substrate, [ADR 0020](0020-engine-perf-harness-and-measurement-protocol.md) perf harness)
**Superseded by:** none

## Context

The spike added a floating **Label** element as a **variant of TextBox** ([`schemas/textBox.ts:14`](../../packages/axoview-lib/src/schemas/textBox.ts) `variant: z.enum(['text','label'])`, plus optional `backgroundColor` / `zIndex` / `isStrikethrough`). A verification pass found the variant approach carries real, partly **intrinsic** debt:

- **Two deep forks** on `variant === 'label'`: a render-geometry fork (billboard chip vs iso-projection, [`TextBox.tsx`](../../packages/axoview-lib/src/components/SceneLayers/TextBoxes/TextBox.tsx) ~L60–235) and a hit-detection fork ([`hitDetection.ts:61,84–89`](../../packages/axoview-lib/src/utils/hitDetection.ts), anchor-tile-only vs footprint). Four further shallow branches.
- **z-order against nodes is impossible.** The `TextBoxes` SceneLayer is DOM-earlier than `NodesCanvas` at equal `zIndex:0`, so a label over a node is **always occluded**; the `zIndex` field is intra-layer only. This is architectural, not a bug a later patch can fix.
- **Anchor-tile-only hit-test:** a wide chip is only clickable on its single center tile.
- **Font model is a heuristic** (`iso fontSize × 24 → px`), not a first-class px size.
- **Double formatting:** a label exposes *both* per-character rich text *and* whole-chip B/I/S — the exact two-layer conflict the code deliberately excludes plain text boxes from.

The branch is **unpushed** — no saved diagram contains a `variant:'label'` element. The data-model reshape is therefore **free now and a permanent load-time migration after first ship.** The user has chosen the clean path ("implement it properly, not a POC").

## Decision

**Extract a dedicated first-class `Label` entity** (a peer of Node / Connector / TextBox / Rectangle per [§5](../ux-principles.md)), retiring the `variant:'label'` text-box. Done **before** the integration→master merge, while migration cost is zero.

1. **Dedicated schema + reducers.** A `Label` model entity with first-class fields (text, position, `backgroundColor`, `bold/italic/strikethrough`, font size in **px**, z-order). The `variant`/label fields are removed from `textBox.ts`; `TextBox` reverts to text-only.
2. **Own render layer, placed above the node layer.** Resolves cross-layer z-order — a Label can sit above nodes (and an explicit z-order field orders within the layer).
3. **Edit model: plain text + whole-chip B/I/S only.** No rich-text editor on labels — this dissolves the two-layer formatting conflict. (Rich text stays on plain TextBox, where per-character formatting is the point.)
4. **Full-chip hit-testing.** The entire chip is selectable, not just the anchor tile — via the proven `NodeLabelHitLayer` DOM hit-proxy pattern (or the Canvas2D path, per §6).
5. **Panel parity = Details / Notes** ([ADR 0030](0030-docked-style-controls-strip.md): no Style tab; styling via the docked strip).
6. **Render substrate is a performance decision, not an afterthought (binding).** Floating labels are billboard chips and a real diagram may carry **hundreds**. Rendering each as a DOM node reintroduces precisely the DOM-layer scaling cliff [ADR 0019](0019-canvas2d-node-render-layer.md) moved nodes *off of* (DOM doesn't cull or sub-linearly scale the way the Canvas2D layer does). The extracted Label layer **must be measured against the [ADR 0020](0020-engine-perf-harness-and-measurement-protocol.md) harness with a label-heavy scenario before merge.** If a DOM-chip layer regresses spawn/pan p95 beyond the noise band, render the Label layer on **Canvas2D** (billboard text, same substrate as node labels) with viewport culling — or virtualize the DOM layer. The substrate is chosen by measurement, and recorded here in an addendum once measured.
7. **Migration: none.** Because the branch is unpushed, the reshape lands with no load-time converter. This window does not reopen — if extraction does not happen before master, this ADR is void and the variant is ratified-with-debt instead.

**2026-07-03:** point 3's parenthetical is refined by [ADR 0034](0034-inline-canvas-text-editing-and-dual-scope-strip-formatting.md): per-character formatting **stays exclusive to the plain TextBox**, but it is now authored **inline on the canvas** (toolbar-less Quill) and driven from the strip's dual-scope format cluster — the rich-text *popup* this point referenced is retired. Labels are unchanged (plain text + whole-chip B/I/S); the two-layer conflict this ADR dissolved for labels is now also dissolved for text boxes, in the opposite direction (content HTML is the single formatting layer; the element-level `is*` flags are legacy-folded at load).

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- §5 parity restored; the intrinsic limits (z-order, hit, font model, double-formatting) are fixed at the root, not patched forever.
- The render substrate is chosen on perf evidence — labels can't silently re-break the large-diagram budget.
- Zero migration; the data model is clean from first ship.

**Negative / risks:**
- One L-sized rebuild slice (schema + reducers + render layer + hit layer + clipboard/persistence). Keep it isolated so the schema diff is reviewable and the zero-migration claim is verifiable in one place.
- A second render layer above nodes adds compositing surface — mitigated by the §6 perf gate.

## Implementation notes (non-binding)

- Mirror the existing entity scaffolding (schema → reducer/scene actions → SceneLayer → hit layer → ItemControls panel → clipboard/persistence). The TextBox subsystem is the closest template; subtract the iso-projection + rich-text pieces.
- Reuse `NodeLabelHitLayer` as the hit-proxy template (§4).
- Keep the connector-label and node-label styling paths untouched — this ADR is only the *floating* Label.

## Acceptance criteria

- **Schema:** a `Label` parses/round-trips; `textBox.ts` no longer carries `variant`/label fields; no migration code exists (verified against the unpushed baseline).
- **Render/z-order:** a label placed over a node renders **above** it.
- **Hit-test:** the full chip width is selectable (not just the anchor tile); a connector passing under the chip is still selectable where the chip isn't.
- **Edit model:** a label cannot carry both rich text and whole-chip B/I/S (single model).
- **Performance (gates the merge):** a label-heavy scenario (≥200 floating labels) shows **no p95 regression beyond the ADR 0020 noise band (<10%)** vs the master baseline for spawn + pan; the chosen substrate is recorded in an addendum.
- **Coverage:** unit/e2e for placement, hit-branch, defaults, and the perf scenario.

## Addendum — render substrate decided by measurement (2026-06-30)

Point 6 (§Decision) deferred the DOM-vs-Canvas2D substrate to the [ADR 0020](0020-engine-perf-harness-and-measurement-protocol.md) harness. The E-slice perf gate now measures it. New scenarios in [`engine-perf.spec.ts`](../../packages/axoview-e2e/perf/engine-perf.spec.ts) at N ∈ {200, 500, 1000}, median-of-7, vs the master spawn baseline ([`perf-results/baseline.md`](../../perf-results/baseline.md)); full table in [`perf-results/e-slice-gate.md`](../../perf-results/e-slice-gate.md):

| Surface (substrate) @ N=1000 | spawn p95 | settle | commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| bare-node baseline (master) | 79.18 ms | 183 ms | — |
| node labels, full B/I/S (**Canvas2D**) | 79.99 ms | 200 ms | 513 ms |
| backgrounds + ≤30px borders (**Canvas2D**) | 79.18 ms | 183 ms | 534 ms |
| connector labels, all styled (DOM) | 79.25 ms | 183 ms | 504 ms |
| **floating labels (DOM chips)** | **184.96 ms** | **600 ms** | **814 ms** |

**Finding.** Every Canvas2D surface adds **≈0** to spawn p95 even at N=1000 (within the <10% noise band). The **DOM floating-label** layer is the lone outlier — it **~2.3× the spawn p95 and ~3× the settle** (over an N-node base), the exact DOM-layer scaling cliff [ADR 0019](0019-canvas2d-node-render-layer.md) moved nodes off of. The pan floor ([`perf-results/pan.md`](../../perf-results/pan.md)) confirms the synchronous-repaint cost is O(visible) regardless of substrate.

**Decision (fires Point 6's "if DOM regresses, use Canvas2D" trigger).** The extracted `Label` layer (slice **C1**) renders on **Canvas2D** — a billboard text layer with viewport culling, the same substrate as node labels (which the table shows scales for free) — placed **above** the node layer for z-order. A DOM chip layer is rejected: it reintroduces the measured cliff. (Virtualizing a DOM layer is a fallback only if a Canvas2D billboard proves infeasible for hit-testing; the `NodeLabelHitLayer` proxy already shows the hit-layer can stay a thin DOM overlay over a Canvas2D paint.) This binds C1's render-layer implementation.

**Confirmed by C1 (2026-06-30).** The shipped `LabelsCanvas` (Canvas2D billboard + a per-(text, fontSize, B/I) layout cache mirroring `NodesCanvas`, full-chip selection via the `LabelHitLayer` DOM proxy) re-measures at **79.25 ms p95 / 183 ms settle @ N=1000** — within the [ADR 0020](0020-engine-perf-harness-and-measurement-protocol.md) <10% band of the 79.18 ms / 183 ms bare-node baseline, ≈ the node-label Canvas2D surface, and **−57% p95 / −69% settle** vs the rejected DOM chip layer. The per-frame `measureText` was the dominant cost; caching the chip layout drops 1000 extra billboards to ≈0 added spawn cost. Full table: [`perf-results/e-slice-gate.md`](../../perf-results/e-slice-gate.md) §2b. The substrate decision holds.
