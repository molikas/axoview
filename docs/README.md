# Axoview Documentation Index

**Axoview** is an isometric diagramming tool (a community fork of FossFLOW / Isoflow). For the product overview, feature list, and lineage, start at the [root README](../README.md). This page is the **map of the `docs/` tree** — what each document is for and when to read it.

## The tree

```
docs/
├── guidelines/   Durable how-we-build references — read before touching a surface (living)
├── reviews/      Frozen reviewer-grade snapshots, immutable once cut
├── adr/          One durable decision each (Proposed → Accepted → Superseded)
├── tactical/     Short-lived working docs; deleted at /feature wrap
└── (root)        README · workflow · deployment · features · manual-test-baseline · upstream-changelog
```

Four kinds of document, by change discipline (see [workflow.md Design principle 4](workflow.md)):

- **Living references** — how the system works *today*; kept in sync with the code. They live in `guidelines/` (how we build) plus a few at `docs/` root (process, deploy, product).
- **Frozen baselines** — point-in-time deep snapshots in `reviews/`. **Never updated after they're cut** — they record what was true on a date, for reviewer hand-off and historical comparison.
- **Decision records (ADRs)** — one durable decision each, with rationale. Change only via the `/feature extend|supersede` discipline.
- **Operational** — moving-state trackers: the roadmap, the open-issues register, the manual-test record.

When a living reference and a frozen baseline disagree, the **living reference wins** for "what's true now"; the baseline tells you what changed since its date.

## Living references

Read these before touching the relevant surface. Each is a quick-reference, not a comprehensive description — they cross-link to the deeper baselines and ADRs for detail.

### `guidelines/` — how we build

| Doc | Read it when… | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| [architecture.md](guidelines/architecture.md) | You need the 5-minute orientation: what the codebase contains and where each piece lives | Feature inventory, store/mode/reducer/scene maps, lessons learned, pointers to all deeper sources |
| [ux-principles.md](guidelines/ux-principles.md) | Building or reviewing any UI surface (canvas, panels, file explorer, layers, dialogs) | The shipped **design language**, expressed as principles so new work doesn't drift |
| [canvas-interaction.md](guidelines/canvas-interaction.md) | Touching canvas **input** — event routing, hit-testing, modes, drag, selection, gestures | The input contract: dispatch spine, the `isRendererInteraction` gate, the 13-mode registry, algorithm contracts, and the load-bearing drag/perf invariants |
| [canvas-rendering-guidelines.md](guidelines/canvas-rendering-guidelines.md) | Touching the GPU bulk layers, the sprite atlas, line-style geometry, or image export | The **pixel**-fidelity contract for the WebGL2 substrate |
| [testing.md](guidelines/testing.md) | You need the regression-suite catalogue — which suite pins which contract, and the coverage gaps | Per-layer suite breakdown, classifications, how to run, CI sharding model |
| [perf-troubleshooting.md](guidelines/perf-troubleshooting.md) | Chasing a render/drag/startup performance problem in the React/DOM layer | Diagnostic playbook + case studies (drag GC cliff, cold-start gap). For GPU-substrate fidelity/perf, use canvas-rendering-guidelines instead |

### `docs/` root — process, deploy, product

| Doc | Read it when… | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| [workflow.md](workflow.md) | Starting a session — which skill fires when, where artifacts land | Canonical session cadence, skill decision table, seven design principles |
| [deployment.md](deployment.md) | Deploying to local dev / Docker / Cloudflare Pages | From-scratch walkthrough per target, auth modes, smoke tests, troubleshooting |
| [features.md](features.md) | You need the complete list of what this fork adds vs upstream | The durable feature inventory, with ADR links. Maintained by `/notes`; the root README carries only the condensed Highlights. Tracks `integration`, so it may list features not yet in a release |

---

## Frozen baselines — `reviews/`

Deep snapshots cut on a date and left immutable. Read for the comprehensive narrative the living docs deliberately don't restate, or to see what a past state looked like. **Each is true as of its freeze point — never as current state.**

| Doc | Covers | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [technical-review-2026-07-08.md](reviews/technical-review-2026-07-08.md) | WebGL2 substrate fold · [ADR 0038](adr/0038-webgl-instanced-render-substrate.md) · v3.5.0 (PR #63) | **Newest snapshot**, but *scoped* — the GPU fold only, not a full-system review. Verdict, anti-cheat integrity, context-loss fixes, deferrals. |
| [technical-review-2026-07.md](reviews/technical-review-2026-07.md) | Labels / text-styling wave · v3.0.3 (v3.1.0 candidate, PR #58) | The most recent **comprehensive** baseline. Delta on 2026-06; first to fold in the full `/audit` report — health scorecard, UX-consistency / perf hot-path / coherence sweeps, risk register, P1–P3 recommendations. |
| [technical-review-2026-06.md](reviews/technical-review-2026-06.md) | post-v1.1 · v2.0.1 | Still the full-depth **architecture narrative** (system + sequence diagrams, deployment topology, file-by-file inventory) that the later reviews deliberately do not restate. |
| [technical-review-2026-05.md](reviews/technical-review-2026-05.md) | post-M10 · v1.0.0 | The original baseline. Kept for historical comparison. |

> **Currency (2026-07-15).** The released line is **v3.7.0** (2026-07-14); the newest review above froze at v3.5.0. **No review yet covers** Google Drive storage (v3.2.0, ADRs 0035–0037), marketing landing / SEO (v3.6.0, ADRs 0040–0041), or Drive-native sharing (v3.7.0, ADRs 0042–0043). For those surfaces read the ADRs + the living references; a comprehensive baseline review covering all three is the largest outstanding docs debt.

**Lineage:** [upstream-changelog.md](upstream-changelog.md) — the verbatim pre-fork `stan-smith/FossFLOW` changelog, preserved for traceability and not maintained going forward. Frozen, but kept at `docs/` root rather than in `reviews/` because it is upstream history, not a review of this codebase.

## Decision records (ADRs)

[docs/adr/](adr/) — **41 ADRs** (40 Accepted · 1 superseded-in-part; 0016/0017 are unused numbers), one durable decision each. Start any new work by reading the ADR header for the contract you're about to touch. *(Table rebuilt 2026-07-15 — it had been stale at 35 rows, ending at 0037, since the Drive-storage promotion; 0038–0043 were missing entirely. Same sweep corrected four statuses: 0022/0023/0025/0028 had sat `Proposed` for weeks after their work shipped — 0028 while `workflow.md` already named it the governing protocol. **Nothing is Proposed today**; if you add one, keep this line honest.)*

## Tactical — [`tactical/`](tactical/)

Short-lived working docs ([workflow.md](workflow.md) Design principle 4): scaffolded by `/feature start`, **deleted** by `/feature wrap` once every downstream artifact ships — the ADRs are the durable record.

**Empty is the healthy state** — see [tactical/README.md](tactical/README.md) for the lifecycle. Three docs that had calcified there were folded out on 2026-07-15: the two `canvas-interaction-*` references became [guidelines/canvas-interaction.md](guidelines/canvas-interaction.md), and `perf-charter.md` was wrapped into [ADR 0020](adr/0020-engine-perf-harness-and-measurement-protocol.md) + PLAN.md's ENG-T3 row.

| In flight | What it is |
|---|---|
| [adr-code-audit.md](tactical/adr-code-audit.md) | ADR ⇄ code conformance audit — verify all 41 ADRs' `Status`, cross-links, and decisions against the code. Scaffolded 2026-07-15. |

---

## Operational

Moving-state trackers. These change as work progresses (under their own change discipline) — they are not quick-references.

| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) | Strategic phase dashboard. Read for context; edited only via `/feature wrap`. |
| [known_issues.md](../known_issues.md) | Register of open runtime issues, deferred fixes, and their risk/complexity. The register of record for divergences (e.g. D-9). |
| [manual-test-baseline.md](manual-test-baseline.md) | Point-in-time manual walk record (2026-05-21). **Historical** — it predates Drive storage, the `/app` split, and Drive-native sharing; re-walk before trusting it as "what Axoview does today." |
