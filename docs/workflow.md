# Workflow — Canonical session cadence

> **Status:** Authoritative · **Last updated:** 2026-07-05 · **Audience:** anyone (human or Claude) opening a session against this repo.
>
> This doc names the canonical sequence of a working session: which skill fires when, where the artifacts land, and what the design principles are. It is the single source of truth for "how we work here." Skill bodies cross-reference this doc; this doc does not duplicate skill bodies.

## Read-first

- [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md) — what the codebase actually contains. Open before any structural decision.
- [docs/ux-principles.md](ux-principles.md) — design language. Every UI-touching session reads this.
- `MEMORY.md` (in your Claude project memory directory) — the persistent context index (auto-loaded by Claude Code).
- [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md) — phase dashboard. **Read for context; never edit phase content outside `/feature wrap`.**
- [docs/adr/](adr/) — every locked decision. New work starts by reading the relevant ADR header.
- [docs/tactical/](tactical/) — short-lived working docs. Each tactical's "Read first" block names the ADRs it implements.

## Stages of a session

A session moves left-to-right through the stages below. Most sessions skip stages — that's normal. The diagram is the **canonical sequence**, not a mandatory walkthrough.

**Cadence anchors (in order):** Session start · Feature scaffolding · Direct work · Verify · Polish · Review · Doc sync · Tactical wrap · Promotion.

## Decision table — which skill when

| Situation | Skill | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Opening a new ADR-worthy decision | `/feature start <topic>` | Scaffolds ADR + tactical with the canonical template. |
| Modifying an accepted ADR | `/feature extend <NNNN>` | Adds a dated addendum without touching prose. |
| Replacing an accepted ADR | `/feature supersede <NNNN>` | New ADR with the cross-link; old one marked superseded. |
| Tactical doc finished | `/feature wrap <topic>` | Adds PLAN.md line, deletes the tactical, retires its memory pointer. |
| End-of-session doc sync | `/notes` | README · architecture.md · testing.md · known_issues.md · PLAN.md · ADR statuses · tactical wrap. **CHANGELOG + versions are auto-cut by semantic-release on merge — never hand-edited.** |
| Heavy multi-dimension review | `/audit` | Static analysis + security + coverage + build + architecture + UX/perf greps. Pre-release or quarterly. |
| Iterative bug-fix / polish loop on shipped surfaces | `/shake-out` | Per-issue verification loop; one coherent commit per bundle. |
| Pre-merge code or security review | `/review` / `/security-review` | Built-in skills; fire just before `/ship`. |
| Promote `integration` → `master` | `/ship` | Test gate + version-coherence check + interactive plan. Doesn't bump versions. |
| Periodic usability validation (pre-release / post-UX-overhaul) | UX journey test — [ADR 0028](adr/0028-ux-journey-testing-protocol.md) | Persona-driven Chrome-agent run + **mandatory code-verification** of severe findings → a `docs/tactical/` backlog. On-demand, not a slash command yet. |

**Boundaries that have caused confusion before:**

- `/audit` vs `/shake-out` — both "find and fix." `/audit` is the heavy sweep that produces an executive report; `/shake-out` is the per-issue polish loop. Pick `/audit` when the problem isn't named yet; pick `/shake-out` when the issues are listed.
- `/notes` vs `/ship` — **neither cuts the release.** semantic-release cuts it in CI on merge to `master` (`.releaserc.json` + `release.yml`): it reads the conventional commits, computes the SemVer bump, bumps all 5 `package.json` versions, regenerates `CHANGELOG.md`, and tags `vX.Y.Z`. `/notes` syncs prose docs (README/architecture/testing/known_issues/PLAN + ADR statuses + tactical wrap); `/ship` promotes `integration`→`master`. `/ship`'s version-coherence check just asserts the 5 package.jsons are equal — they always are, because `update-version` keeps them in lockstep, so a mismatch signals an illegal hand-edit. **The old date-based `YYYY.M.D` manual-cut convention is retired.**
- `/feature start` (convention-memory write) vs `/notes` Phase 4 (convention-memory edit). `/feature` owns writes during scaffolding; `/notes` Phase 4 only deletes bullets during wrap. Don't run both back-to-back on the same convention-memory entry.

## Verify — what to run before committing

Build/test scope by change class:

| Change class | Required | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `axoview-lib/src/` | `npm test --workspace=packages/axoview-lib`, `npm run build` (both libs) | `tsc --noEmit` in lib root |
| `axoview-app/src/` | `npm run build`, dev server + browser walkthrough | `npm test --workspace=packages/axoview-app` (where coverage exists) |
| `axoview-backend/` | `npm run build`, manual backend smoke (curl `/api/config`) | (no jest config today — gap tracked in C.8) |
| `axoview-worker/` | `npx wrangler dev` smoke | (no jest config today — gap tracked in C.8) |
| Cross-package | Both lib + app builds; full test suite | `/audit` Phase 4 |
| Docs only | None | None |
| Deployment artifacts (Dockerfile / compose / nginx / wrangler) | Manual deploy smoke against the affected target | `/deploy-check` (deferred per A.9.4 #3) |

**UI verification is mandatory** for any change touching `packages/axoview-*/src/components/` — start the dev server, exercise the feature in a browser, monitor for regressions in neighbouring surfaces. Type-check + test suite verify code correctness; the browser is the only thing that verifies feature correctness.

**Commit subject convention** — `@commitlint/config-conventional`'s `subject-case` rule rejects upper-case sentence-style subjects. Reference codes like `T2`, `B-9a`, `M8`, `ADR 0011 pass` are exempt (not English words); narrative phrases inside the subject must be lower-case (e.g. `locked decision #16` rather than `Locked Decision #16`). The convention is enforced locally by simple-git-hooks (G8) and in CI by commitlint (T2 G3).

## Tactical-driven sessions

Some work is too large for a single ADR scaffold but too narrow for PLAN.md. That's a tactical doc. Recent examples in the canonical pattern:

- [docs/tactical/productization-audit.md](tactical/productization-audit.md) (this audit) — 8 workstreams, 9 cross-cutting themes, ADRs 0007–0010 spawned, multiple cleanup tacticals queued. Lives until M10 ships; deleted at wrap-up.
- [docs/tactical/layout-revamp.md](tactical/layout-revamp.md) — locked-decision exemplar; references back from `/feature` template.

**The tactical-driven session pattern:**

1. `/feature start <topic>` scaffolds the tactical (and any ADRs it forks off).
2. Each working session reads the tactical's "Read first" block, picks a workstream, appends to its Findings register.
3. Discovery hygiene rule (see Design principle 1): every Findings register row cites `file:line` or a grep result. No theory without evidence.
4. Synthesis happens once discovery is "definition of done" complete. Cross-workstream themes go in a `## Synthesis` section.
5. Synthesis spawns the durable artifacts (ADRs) and the downstream cleanup tacticals.
6. `/feature wrap <topic>` retires the tactical once every downstream artifact has shipped.

This audit (`productization-audit.md`) is the most recent worked example. Future audits or large initiatives should reproduce its shape: Phase A discovery → Phase A synthesis → Phase C artifact authoring → wrap.

## Design principles

### 1. Discovery hygiene — every claim is grounded

**Rule:** every Findings register row, every theme, every observation cites a file path with line number, a grep result, or a runtime artifact. No "I think" without "here's where I'm looking."

**Why:** the audit's value is reproducibility. If a finding can't be re-walked by a fresh reader running the same grep, it isn't a finding — it's an intuition. The discrepancies between intuition and code are where bugs hide.

**Practiced version:** when a session falls into "I keep reading the same file and the answer isn't there," the move is to instrument (logging, a script, a screenshot) and let the runtime answer. See the `feedback_diagnose_with_logs` memory for it.

### 2. Screenshot-driven, not theory-driven

**Rule:** when working on a visible surface, the screenshot or the live browser is the source of truth. Theories about what code "should" do are subordinate to what the user sees.

**Why:** see the `feedback_be_serious_not_eager` memory. Multiple past sessions piled extra moves onto a delivered artifact because the agent felt eager; that pattern degrades trust and burns context. **Plans aren't fixes.** Bundling extra moves after a delivered artifact is anti-pattern.

This principle is why `/audit` and `/shake-out` both emphasize "verify, don't pile on" — the design didn't accidentally converge there; the memory was the driver.

### 3. Intent verification — stop signs

**Rule:** a why-question from the user about a chosen approach is a stop. A visual/words mismatch in the user's request is a question, not a decision to pick a side. See the `feedback_intent_verification` memory.

### 4. Decisions live in ADRs; status lives in PLAN.md; details live in tacticals

The three-tier doc convention is the project's most-used pattern. See the `project_docs_convention` memory.

- **ADRs** — durable. One concern per ADR. Status: Proposed → Accepted → Superseded.
- **Tacticals** — short-lived. Deleted at wrap; PLAN.md gets a one-line entry pointing to the ADRs.
- **PLAN.md** — strategic dashboard. Never edited outside `/feature wrap`.

### 5. Post-rename memory-pointer policy

When a file is retired (deleted, renamed, or absorbed), the memory pointer that references it MUST be updated in the same commit. Two consequences:

- **Skill bodies that reference retired files are stale references.** Fix them at the retirement boundary, not at the next session's discovery.
- **Memory entries that point to retired files must be removed or rewritten.** A memory entry that points at a non-existent file degrades all future agents that load it.

This is why C.9.2 (skill stale-ref pass) ran together with C.9.1 (this doc) — the retirement of `flare_plan.md`, `session-ux-revamp.md`, and `current_architecture.md` left pointers in three skill bodies that this audit identified and closed.

### 6. Bash idioms are the lingua franca

Skill bodies use `cd packages/...`, `npm run ...`, `grep`. Claude Code's harness translates `cd` cleanly across Windows/PowerShell + Bash, so the pattern works on the active dev platform. **A strict-PowerShell-only environment would trip.** This is documented friction, not a rewrite target.

### 7. Whole-experience coherence — trace the ripple

**Rule:** every proposed change states what it makes **redundant**, what it **contradicts**, and what it **orphans** — and reconciles or explicitly flags each *before* it ships. A fix that lands cleanly in isolation but leaves a sibling control stranded, duplicates an affordance, or depends on a surface that doesn't exist is **not done**. Grep to confirm any surface a plan leans on actually exists — *"put it in the X menu"* requires that X menu to be real, or scoped as a build dependency.

**Why:** a per-issue study is well-grounded (Principle 1) yet coherence-blind *by construction* — isolating issues is exactly where cross-issue contradictions hide. The 2026-06-18 canvas-ux-overhaul scaffold routed a command into a context menu that doesn't exist while a sibling ADR reassigned that menu's trigger (right-click) to pan. This is the **opposite** failure from Principle 2's "don't pile on" — hold both at once: **minimal moves, maximal coherence.** See the `feedback_whole_experience_coherence` memory.

**Practiced version:** `/feature` (Phase 1.5) and `/audit` (Phase 5d) run a mandatory consequences pass that names the redundant/contradicted/orphaned surfaces per change and reconciles against mirroring surfaces — selection two-way sync ([ux-principles §4.1](ux-principles.md#41-two-way-panel--canvas-sync)), item-type parity (§5), the edit/view/present split (§11).

## Review gate

`/review` and `/security-review` (built-in plugin skills) fire **between `/notes` doc sync and `/ship` promotion**. Both are surfaced by the Claude Code system reminder when relevant. The cadence diagram shows the slot; the skills themselves are plugin-provided and not in `.claude/commands/`.

## UX journey testing

The usability analog of the perf harness ([ADR 0020](adr/0020-engine-perf-harness-and-measurement-protocol.md)
+ [perf-charter](tactical/perf-charter.md)): an **on-demand**, persona-driven journey test of the live UI,
governed by [ADR 0028 — UX Journey-Testing Protocol](adr/0028-ux-journey-testing-protocol.md). Run it
**periodically** — before a release, after a broad UX-surface change (an overhaul like ADRs 0022–0027), or
when usability is in question — **not** every session.

- **Driver:** the Claude for Chrome agent (Sonnet-class) against the `integration` preview (storage-less;
  server-mode surfaces need a self-hosted build).
- **Personas:** five fixed personas — beginner · intermediate · expert · presenter · keyboard/i18n — one per run.
- **Discipline:** the capability map + do-not-report list are **regenerated from the current build each
  run** (the in-app Help dialog is the canonical interaction model), never copied — a stale map poisons the
  run (it did on the first attempt).
- **Mandatory verification gate:** every S1/S2 finding is cross-checked against current code (`file:line`)
  before it earns a fix task — the agent manufactures false blockers (the first run's two loudest "S1s"
  were both artifacts). Confirmed artifacts are recorded, not actioned.
- **Output:** a short-lived `docs/tactical/` backlog (the implementation handover) — the first run was
  `ux-retest-fixes.md` (shipped + wrapped; decisions in the ADR 0019/0022/0023/0025 addenda + git history).

## Process debt — deferred skills

Per [productization-audit.md A.9.4](tactical/productization-audit.md), nine missing-skill candidates were catalogued. The triage:

| # | Candidate | Disposition | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/release-check` (pre-M10 ship gate) | **defer** | Build after the first productized release ships. |
| 2 | `/trace` (Phase B verification harness) | **defer** | Gated on ADR 0007 acceptance + `trace.ts` landing in `axoview-lib`. |
| 3 | `/deploy-check` (verify Dockerfile/compose/wrangler against ADRs) | **defer** | Build alongside C.8 git-automation tactical; gated on ADRs 0009/0010 accepted. |
| 4 | `/regression-snapshot` (behavioural baseline pre-cleanup) | **defer** | Gated on M9 (Playwright suite live). |
| 5 | `/spawn-tactical` (scaffold tactical from register row) | **reject** | `/feature start` covers the canonical path; the row→tactical translation resists templating. |
| 6 | `/cwd-rename` (one-shot folder rename + memory rewrite) | **reject** | One-shot ops task; encoding it adds maintenance load for zero future value. |
| 7 | `/workflow-check` (print cadence + decision table) | **defer** | Fold into a "Quick reference" section here instead of a skill; saves skill-list bloat. |
| 8 | `/ux-baseline` (Phase 5b grep extract) | **defer** | Fold into `/shake-out` as an optional first-step flag. |
| 9 | `/perf-baseline` (Phase 5c grep extract) | **defer** | Same fold-into-/shake-out treatment as #8. |

**2026-06-21 addition — `/ux-journey-test`:** assemble persona prompts → run the Chrome-agent journey test
→ verification cross-check. A new deferred candidate from [ADR 0028](adr/0028-ux-journey-testing-protocol.md),
sibling to the deferred `/ux-baseline` (#8). Documented-only for now (the protocol lives in ADR 0028); build
the command if on-demand UX runs become frequent enough to be worth templating.

**Net effect on productization gate (M8):** zero new skills must be built. The productization baseline blocks on alignment-and-cadence work (this doc + C.9.2 stale-ref pass), not on skill construction.

### Empirical notes

- **Adding `.gitattributes` mid-project is safe when the existing tree is already LF-coherent** — verify with `git diff --stat` or `git status --short` immediately post-add before committing. C.2 Q3 (2026-05-20 / commit `264887a`) confirmed no CRLF renormalization storm on the Windows-dev tree, suggesting prior commits had already respected the LF convention. The risk pattern to watch for is `git status` showing dozens of unrelated paths as modified after the file lands — that is the renormalization tax, and it should be staged as its own follow-up commit so the audit's actual content edits aren't drowned in CRLF noise.
- **PLAN.md edits should commit eagerly with the surrounding work.** Two PLAN.md blocks ("Completed alongside 2D" + "Playwright migration shipped") sat uncommitted for several sessions and finally landed in commit `39c5130` only because they happened to be in the same file as an unrelated audit-driven edit. Process debt: future sessions should commit PLAN.md alongside the work that motivated the edit rather than letting it accumulate uncommitted.

## Cadence anomalies — locked resolutions

The audit identified nine anomalies (A.9.5 S1–S9). The ones with a written resolution:

- **S1 — `/audit` produces no persistent artifact.** Resolution: high-value findings get filed via `/notes` Q2 immediately after; raw audit-run output is ephemeral. `reports/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` may be added later as a low-cost alternative.
- **S2 — No skill covers session-start.** Resolution: this doc's "Stages of a session" section is the explicit 4-step (memory · plan · pick · TodoWrite) sequence. No new skill needed.
- **S3 — `/feature start` and `/notes` Phase 4 both touch convention memory.** Resolution: locked above ("`/feature` owns writes; `/notes` Phase 4 only deletes bullets during wrap").
- **S4 — Build-verification scope is implicit.** Resolution: the change-class table under "Verify" above is the explicit per-class scope.
- **S5 — UI verification not skill-encoded.** Resolution: documented above as **mandatory** for any `packages/axoview-*/src/components/` edit.
- **S6 — `/ship` test gate excludes backend + worker.** Resolution: documented as a scope choice (no tests exist there yet); C.8 git-automation tactical adds backend + worker test scaffolding as a future expansion.
- **S7 — No skill names the Phase B trace harness path.** Resolution: reserved slot in the cadence; `/trace` (deferred A.9.4 #2) plugs in when ADR 0007 lands.
- **S8 — Built-in `/review` and `/security-review` integration undocumented.** Resolution: "Review gate" section above names both as the canonical pre-merge step.
- **S9 — `/notes` opt-in cut vs `/ship` mandatory version-coherence.** Resolution: **superseded** — releases are auto-cut by semantic-release on merge to `master` (`.releaserc.json`), so neither skill cuts a release. `/ship`'s version-coherence check now just guards against illegal hand-edits (all 5 package.jsons must stay equal).
