/**
 * The merged bulk's paint-order comparator (R3/GPU-13, ADR 0038 §8).
 *
 * Tiers, high → low: **layer stack, z-index, TYPE RANK, iso depth** — then the
 * caller's array order, via a stable sort.
 *
 * **Type rank sits ABOVE iso depth, and that placement is load-bearing.** §8's
 * skeleton reads "keyed by `resolveRenderOrder(layerOrder, zIndex, isoDepth)`
 * with a type rank as the tiebreaker at equal keys", and taken literally that
 * does not work: iso depth is fed inconsistently across types today
 * (`NodesCanvas` passes `-tile.x - tile.y`, `LabelsCanvas` passes `0`,
 * connectors and rectangles do not sort at all), so a node at a positive tile
 * would sort BELOW every rectangle and label on the same layer at the same
 * z-index and the keys would never be equal for the tiebreaker to reach. That is
 * precisely the "visible re-ordering of existing documents" §8 says must not
 * happen. Ranking types first and letting iso depth separate only same-type
 * entities is the formulation that delivers what §8 decided; corrected here
 * while implementing the merge.
 *
 * The picker (`hitDetection.ts`) resolves all three tiers from this same helper,
 * and since 2026-08-08 it ranks ACROSS entity kinds with this same comparator —
 * so renderer and picker agree by construction. Closing PROJ-10's residual (the
 * layer tier, which the picker was blind to while it was handed a flat scene) is
 * what completed that; the merge had already made layer and z-index cross a type,
 * which the picker's fixed branch precedence could not express. Text boxes and
 * connector label chips remain outside the sort on both sides — they are DOM
 * above the canvas. See `pickerAgreement.contract.test.ts`.
