/**
 * CLASS GATE — the renderer and the picker resolve paint order the same way.
 *
 * ADR 0038 §3 says picking stays geometric: nothing may make hit-testing depend
 * on draw order or GPU readback. The GPU-13 brief §5 adds the other half — after
 * the merge, `hitDetection.ts` and the merged bulk canvas both sort by
 * `resolveRenderOrder`, so they agree *by construction*, "which is worth
 * asserting in a gate". This is that gate.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SCOPE — all three tiers, and cross-type (WIDENED 2026-08-08 by the program
 * final sweep, which closed PROJ-10's residual).
 *
 * This gate shipped with the GPU-13 merge scoped to the zIndex and iso-depth
 * tiers, because `hitDetection` was handed a flat `HitTestScene` with no
 * `layers` array and resolved every entity at `layerOrder: 0`. §4 PINNED that
 * divergence rather than hiding it, and said in as many words that closing the
 * residual must come here and widen the gate. This is that widening: §4 now
 * asserts the agreement it used to assert the absence of, and §5 pins what is
 * still — deliberately — out of the sort.
 *
 * The re-derivation that widened it beyond the layer tier: the merge made the
 * renderer resolve **cross-type** as well (one `compareSceneDrawOrder` sort over
 * all four bulk kinds, so layer and z-index cross an entity type at last), while
 * the picker still returned the first branch to hit. PROJ-10's residual was
 * scoped before that landed, so "the picker cannot see the layer bucket"
 * understated it — the picker could not resolve cross-type at all. Both are
 * closed together, because at equal layer and z-index `SCENE_TYPE_RANK`
 * reproduces the picker's historical precedence exactly (node > connector >
 * rectangle) and the layer-only fix is the more complicated one to write.
