// The connector tool's hit-test and its degeneracy rules.
//
// The I4 carry-forward note put it plainly: *the connector tool trusts geometry
// and distrusts nothing else*. Its hit-tests called `getItemAtTile({ tile,
// scene })` with neither the ADR 0023 `point` nor `isItemInteractable`, while
// every `Cursor` path passes both — so a node on a locked layer, or on a hidden
// one, was a valid anchor target (CONN-15), and an off-grid node's drawn body
// was invisible to the tool (CONN-03, which did not fire at realistic offsets
// but is the same hole). And *degenerate connectors are creatable four ways and
// rejected none*: self-loop (CONN-10), zero-length free-floating (CONN-07),
// half-attached (CONN-13), and the abandoned self-anchored provisional from
// I1/PTR-07 — nothing in the reducer, `validateView` or `modelSchema` objects to
// any of them.
//
// Both modes (`Connector`, `ReconnectAnchor`) go through this module so the
// answer cannot drift between drawing a connector and re-anchoring one.

/**
 * What the connector tool is pointing at — an interactable ITEM, or nothing.
 *
 * Two differences from the bare `getItemAtTile` the tool used to call:
 *
 *  1. **The layer gate.** A locked or hidden node reads as empty tile, so the
 *     tool cannot bind an anchor to an entity the user has declared off-limits
 *     or cannot even see (CONN-15). Same predicate the pointer modes are handed.
 *  2. **The ADR 0023 cursor point.** Item hit-testing becomes pixel-accurate
 *     against rendered footprints, so an off-grid node is connectable where it
 *     is DRAWN rather than at its grid cell (CONN-03).
 *
 * Returns null for anything that is not an interactable ITEM: the connector
 * tool's only valid anchor target is a node, and every other result (a
 * connector, a rectangle, a locked node) means "treat this as bare tile".
