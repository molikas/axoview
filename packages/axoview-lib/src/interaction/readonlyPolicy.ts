// ─── Read-only enforcement policy (exploratory campaign wave 2) ──────────────
//
// `EXPLORABLE_READONLY` is the mode the `/display/<diagramId>` viewer route runs
// in. Before this module it was enforced *per surface, by memory*: the pointer
// effect returned early on `INTERACTIONS_DISABLED` (which EXPLORABLE_READONLY
// does not map to — its starting mode is PAN), `handleFunctionKeys` checked
// `editorMode` for F2, and `RightSidebar` passed `readOnly` to exactly one of
// its six panel branches. Everything else was live: tool hotkeys armed drawing
// tools, Delete destroyed items, Ctrl+X/V mutated the model, the z-order and
// arrow-nudge shortcuts wrote, and four of the five element panels rendered
// their full editing surface (I1/PTR-01..03, F2/VIEW-11).
//
// The cure is opt-IN rather than opt-out: every canvas surface that a viewer can
// reach is listed below with an explicit access class, and the dispatchers ask
// this module instead of testing `editorMode` themselves. A surface that is not
// in the table has no access class, so the class gate
// (`__tests__/readonlySurfaces.contract.test.ts`) fails until someone decides
// what it is — a new keyboard shortcut or element panel cannot inherit "live in
// read-only" by omission the way this whole class did.
//
// See ADR 0047 §3 (class gates), and docs/reviews/exploratory-2026-07.md for the
// campaign record this class came out of.

 * What a surface is allowed to do under a non-EDITABLE `editorMode`.
 *
 *  - `viewer` — read-only by construction: it cannot change the model and
 *    cannot arm a mode that can. A viewer keeps it.
 *  - `editor` — it writes the model, or it arms an interaction mode that
 *    writes the model. Refused unless `editorMode === 'EDITABLE'`.
 *
 * The distinction is about REACHABLE effect, not intent: `selectAll` does not
 * itself write anything, but it switches the canvas into CURSOR — a live
 * editing mode whose drag moves items — so it is an `editor` surface.
