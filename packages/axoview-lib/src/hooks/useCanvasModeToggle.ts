// useCanvasModeToggle — the iso↔2D switch, shared by the editor ToolMenu and

// projection too). `canvasMode` is a uiState/localStorage concern only — it is
// never written to the document — so a viewer toggling it changes their OWN
// view and nothing else.
//
// The viewport-preservation effect lives here rather than at a call site so
// both surfaces get it: previously it sat inside ToolMenu, which view-only mode
// never mounts, so surfacing the button alone would have made a viewer's zoom
// pop on every switch.
//
// The effect assumes ONE live consumer at a time — two mounted simultaneously
// would each apply the scroll correction. That holds today: EDITOR_MODE_MAPPING
// (UiOverlay) grants TOOL_MENU to EDITABLE only, and the present chrome renders
// only in EXPLORABLE_READONLY.
