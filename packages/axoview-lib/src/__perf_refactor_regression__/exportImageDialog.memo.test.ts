/**
 * PERF REGRESSION — H-3: ExportImageDialog must be wrapped in React.memo
 *
 * ExportImageDialog was not memoised.  Every UiOverlay re-render (which
 * previously happened at mouse rate) would re-create the dialog subtree even
 * when dialog === null and the dialog was not mounted.  React's reconciler
 * still evaluates the expression:
 *
 *   {dialog === DialogTypeEnum.EXPORT_IMAGE && <ExportImageDialog ... />}
 *
 * If ExportImageDialog itself is not memoised, once mounted it re-renders on
 * every parent update.  The dialog contains heavy canvas/SVG logic.
 *
 * Contract: ExportImageDialog must be wrapped in React.memo.
